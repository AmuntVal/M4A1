fixed animation bugs to make the character behave normally

implemented doublejump in the air to make the character able to jump onto the edge wall without walking on the slope

To doublejump, press space after your first jump, while you are in still the air, before you land onto the earth.
Only doublejump allowed, you can't jump a thrid time before you land.
